# Advanced-Calcultaor

This Python project is an interactive calculator that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. It supports chained calculations, letting users continue operations on 
the previous result without restarting.

The program uses functions mapped in a dictionary to handle each operation, demonstrating clean code 
organization and efficient use of first-class functions. Users input numbers and select operators, and 
the calculator outputs results dynamically, offering a fully interactive experience.

This project highlights key programming concepts such as function design, dictionaries, loops, and input 
handling. It also reflects real-world applications like financial calculations, point-of-sale systems, and 
scientific computation tools, providing a practical foundation for building more advanced computational 
programs in Python.
